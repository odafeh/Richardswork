            <p>I’m a budding Front-End Web Developer learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
                I enjoy building clean, simple websites and I’m working toward becoming a full-stack developer.</p>

            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I’m a passionate and curious web developer currently studying at the University of Benin. Over the past
                months I’ve been steadily building my skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, learning how to turn static
                designs into fully responsive, interactive websites. My goal is to master the foundations of front-end
                development, move into full-stack, and eventually combine my programming skills with cybersecurity — an
                area I’m deeply interested in.
                I enjoy challenging myself to build clean, efficient, and user-friendly interfaces. Even though I’m
                still early in my journey, I’ve already created small projects like calculators, form validations, and
                portfolio layouts to strengthen my understanding. Every project teaches me something new about problem
                solving and best practices.
                Outside of coding, I like basketball, exploring new technology trends, and learning how digital tools
                can solve everyday problems. I believe in continuous improvement and self-discipline, and I’m excited
                about growing as a developer and working with others on meaningful projects.
                Feel free to browse through my projects, connect with me on social media, or reach out if you’d like to
                collaborate.</p>

                    <h3>Responsive Web Design</h3>
                    <p>I design and build clean, responsive websites that adapt to any screen size desktop, tablet or
                        mobile.
                        My focus is on creating layouts that are visually appealing and easy to navigate, so visitors
                        get a
                        smooth experience no matter what device they’re using. From colour palettes and typography to
                        flexible
                        grids, I ensure every design looks consistent and professional.</p>

                    <h3>Front-End Development</h3>
                    <p>Using modern front-end technologies like HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript, I develop user interfaces
                        that
                        are
                        fast, interactive and accessible. I pay attention to performance, cross-browser compatibility
                        and
                        clean
                        code so that the websites I build load quickly and are easy to maintain or extend in the future.
                        I
                        also
                        implement smooth animations and effects to make the user experience more engaging.</p>

                    <h3>Website Redesign & Optimization</h3>
                    <p>I help improve existing websites by updating their design, fixing usability issues and optimising
                        them
                        for better performance. Whether it’s refreshing outdated visuals, restructuring content, or
                        making a
                        site mobile-friendly, my goal is to give clients a modern, user-focused presence online that
                        performs
                        well in search engines and converts visitors into customers.</p>
